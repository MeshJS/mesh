            the Conway ledger era is Cardano's initial on-chain governance
            design. This system was allows the community to vote on how the
            chain is managed, such as how treasury funds are spent and changes
            to protocol parameters. This system is designed to be decentralized
            and transparent, allowing the community to decide the future of the
            network.
