      <p>
        We can now communicate with the hydra-node through its WebSocket API on
        the terminal. This is a duplex connection and we can just insert
        commands directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Send this command to initialize a head through the WebSocket connection:
      </p>

      <Codeblock data={`code about starting node`} />
      <Button
        onClick={() => openHead()}
        style={loading ? "warning" : "light"}
        disabled={loading}
      >
        Open Head
      </Button>

      <p>
        The initiation process might take some time as it includes submitting a
        transaction on-chain. Upon successful initiation, both Hydra nodes and
        their clients will display a <code>HeadIsInitializing</code> message,
        listing the parties required to commit.
      </p>

      <p>
        To commit funds to the head, choose which UTxO you would like to make
        available on layer 2. Use the HTTP API of hydra-node to commit all funds
        given to <code>{"{alice,bob}-funds.vk"}</code> beforehand:
      </p>

      <Codeblock data={`code about starting node`} />
      <Button
        onClick={() => commitFunds()}
        style={loading ? "warning" : "light"}
        disabled={loading}
      >
        Commit Funds
      </Button>

      <p>
        After you've prepared your transactions, the hydra-node will find all
        UTxOs associated with the funds key and create a draft of the commit
        transaction. You'll then sign this transaction using the funds key and
        submit it to the Cardano layer 1 network.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the hydra-node sees this transaction, you should see a Committed
        status displayed on your WebSocket connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        When both parties, alice and bob, have committed, the Hydra head will
        open automatically. You'll see a HeadIsOpen message appear in the
        WebSocket session, confirming the activation of the head. This message
        will include details such as the starting balance and UTxO entries.
        Notably, these entries will match exactly those committed to the head,
        including transaction hashes and indices, ensuring transparency and
        consistency.
      </p>

      <p>The head is now operational and ready for further activities.</p>
    </>
