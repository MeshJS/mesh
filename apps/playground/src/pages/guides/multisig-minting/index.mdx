A multi-signature (multi-sig) transaction requires more than one user to sign a transaction prior to the transaction being broadcast on a blockchain. You can think of it like a husband and wife savings account, where both signatures are required to spend the funds, preventing one spouse from spending the money without the approval of the other. For a multi-sig transaction, you can include 2 or more required signers, these signers can be wallets ([Browser Wallet](/apis/wallets/browserwallet) or [Mesh Wallet](/apis/wallets/meshwallet)) or Plutus script.

In this guide, we will build a multi-sig transaction for minting. There are 2 wallets involved,

1. client wallet belonging to the user who wishes to buy a native asset
2. application wallet that holds the forging script

In this guide, we will connect to user's CIP30 wallet (`BrowserWallet`) to request for a minting transaction. Then, the backend application wallet (`MeshWallet`) will build the transaction, and we will sign it with our wallet. [Check out the code here](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/blob/main/apps/playground/src/pages/guides/multisig-minting/demo.tsx).

## Connect wallet (client)

In this section, we will connect client's wallet and obtain their wallet address and UTXO.

Users can connect their wallet with `BrowserWallet`:

```
import { BrowserWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';
const wallet = await BrowserWallet.enable(walletName);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `CardanoWallet` component to connect to the user's wallet:

```
import { CardanoWallet, useWallet } from "@meshsdk/react";

export default function Page() {
  const { wallet, connected } = useWallet();

  return <CardanoWallet />
}
```

Then, we get client's wallet address and UTXOs:

```
const recipientAddress = await wallet.getChangeAddress();
const utxos = await wallet.getUtxos();
```

The change address will be the address receiving the minted NFTs and the transaction's change. Additionally, we will need the client's wallet UTXOs to build the minting transaction.

We can search for the UTXOs required for the transaction with one of the coin selection algorithms, such as `largestFirst` or `experimentalSelectUtxos`. In this example, we use `experimentalSelectUtxos` to select the UTXOs required for the transaction.:

```
const assetMap = new Map<Unit, Quantity>();
assetMap.set("lovelace", mintingFee);
const selectedUtxos = experimentalSelectUtxos(assetMap, utxos, "5000000");
```

The `experimentalSelectUtxos` function will return the UTXOs required for the transaction. The `mintingFee` is the cost of minting the NFT, and the `5000000` is an amount that creates a buffer for the transaction fee.

Next, we will send the `selectedUtxos` and `recipientAddress` to the backend to build the minting transaction.

## Build transaction (application)

In this section, we will build the minting transaction.

In this guide, we won't be showing how to set up RESTful APIs and backend servers. There are thousands of tutorials on YouTube, we recommend building your backend server with [Vercel API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api) or [NestJs](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nestjs) or [ExpressJs](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=expressjs).

First, we initialize a [blockchain provider](/providers) and [`Mesh Wallet`](/apis/wallets/meshwallet). In this example, we use mnemonic to restore our wallet, but you can initialize a wallet with mnemonic phrases, private keys, and Cardano CLI generated keys.

```
const blockchainProvider = new BlockfrostProvider(
  '<blockfrost key here>'
);

const meshWallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 0,
  fetcher: blockchainProvider,
  submitter: blockchainProvider,
  key: {
    type: 'mnemonic',
    words: yourMnemonic,
  },
});
```

Next, let's define the forging script, here we used the first wallet address, but you can also define using `NativeScript`, see [Transaction - Minting assets](/apis/transaction/minting):

```
const meshWalletAddress = meshWallet.getChangeAddress();
const forgingScript = ForgeScript.withOneSignature(meshWalletAddress);
```

Then, we define the `AssetMetadata` which contains the NFT metadata. In a NFT collection mint, you would need a selection algorithm and a database to select available NFTs.

```
const assetName = 'MeshToken';

const assetMetadata: AssetMetadata = {
  name: 'Mesh Token',
  image: 'ipfs://QmRzicpReutwCkM6aotuKjErFCUD213DpwPq6ByuzMJaua',
  mediaType: 'image/jpg',
  description: 'This NFT was minted by Mesh (https://meshjs.dev/).',
};
```

After that, we create the `Mint` object:

```
const asset: Mint = {
  assetName: assetName,
  assetQuantity: '1',
  metadata: assetMetadata,
  label: '721',
  recipient: recipientAddress,
};
```

Finally, we are ready to create the transaction. We set the transaction inputs, mint the asset, send the lovelace to the bank wallet, set the change address, and build the transaction:

```
const tx = new Transaction({ initiator: meshWallet });
tx.setTxInputs(userUtxos);
tx.mintAsset(forgingScript, asset);
tx.sendLovelace(bankWalletAddress, mintingFee);
tx.setChangeAddress(recipientAddress);
const unsignedTx = await tx.build();
```

Optionally, we can mask the metadata so users do not see the NFT metadata:

```
originalMetadata = Transaction.readMetadata(unsignedTx);
```

This `originalMetadata` can be stored in a database to merge with the original transaction after user signature.

Send the transaction to the client for their signature.

## Sign transaction (client)

In this section, we need the client's signature to send the payment to the `bankWalletAddress`. The client's wallet will open and prompts for payment password. Note that the partial sign is set to `true`.

```
const signedTx = await wallet.signTx(unsignedTx, true);
```

## Sign transaction (application)

The backend will sign the transaction with the application wallet:

```
const meshWalletSignedTx = await systemWallet.signTx(unsignedTx, true);
```

If you have masked the metadata, you can merge the metadata with the signed transaction:

```
const signedOriginalTx = Transaction.writeMetadata(
  unsignedTx,
  originalMetadata,
);
const meshWalletSignedTx = await systemWallet.signTx(
  signedOriginalTx,
  true,
);
```

## Submit transaction (application)

Finally, we submit the transaction to the blockchain:

```
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signedTx);
```

Voila! You can build any multi-sig transactions!
