## Code of Conduct

We have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Contributing Guide

Mesh SDK project welcomes all constructive contributions. Contributions take many forms, from code for bug fixes and enhancements, to additions and fixes to documentation, additional tests, triaging incoming pull requests and issues, and more!

Check out our [docs](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/tree/main/docs) on GitHub for guidelines and introductions to the project.

### Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes to documentation, code, etc. Even long term committers must use pull requests.

No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

For non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other timezones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection. During a review, committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.

### Logging Issues

Log an [issue](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh/issues) for any question or problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue, and any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only exception is security disclosures which should be sent privately.

Committers may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and add appropriate metadata before the issue is addressed.

Please be courteous and respectful. Every participant is expected to follow the project's Code of Conduct.
