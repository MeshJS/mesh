# Content Ownership

This contract allows you to create a content registry and users can create content that is stored in the registry.

It facilitates on-chain record of content (i.e. file on IPFS) ownership and transfer. While one cannot prefer others from obtaining a copy of the content, the app owner of the contract can serve the single source of truth of who owns the content. With the blockchain trace and record in place, it provides a trustless way to verify the ownership of the content and facilitates further application logics such as royalties, licensing, etc.
