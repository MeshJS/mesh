# Components

## Grid

- the grid is a virtual space in 2 dimensions (`x`, `y`).
- there's no on-chain representation of the grid
- coordinates on each dimension are discrete (integer values)
- the coordinates `(0, 0)` are considered the center of the grid

## Ship

- a ship is identified by a Cardano native asset token of a specific policy id. We call this class of token `ShipToken`.
- the UTxO that holds the `ShipToken` defines the state of the ship. We call this class of UTxOs `ShipState`.
- the datum of the `ShipState` UTxO contains information about current coordinates and available fuel.
- all `ShipState` UTxOs belong to a script address that constraints changes that can be applies to the state. We call this script `SpaceTimeScript`.

## Pilot

- the pilot is a Cardano native token from a particular policy id that is locked in an address managed by the participant. We call this class of token `PilotToken`.
- the goal of this token is to ensure that changes to the `ShipState` are triggered by the rightful owner of the ship.
- the pilot token needs to be present in any of the inputs of a transaction that progresses the state of the ship.

## Fuel Pellet

- a fuel pellet is freely available source of fuel tokens that are located at a fixed position in the grid.
- a fuel pellet is represented by a UTxO that contains any amount of `FuelToken` and is locked at a specific script address. We call this class of UTxO `PelletState`
- the datum of a `PelletState` defines the position of the pellet within the _grid_.
- the amount of fuel tokens in the `PelletState` represents the available fuel.

## Asteria

- Asteria is an asteroid located at the center of the grid that represents the end goal of the challenge.
- Asteria is represented by an UTxO that called `AsteriaUtxo`. 
- This UTxO will hold the aggregated rewards of the challenge.
- This UTxO holds a datum with a counter that controls a sequence used to enforce ship uniqueness.
